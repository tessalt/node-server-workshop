# Building an HTTP Server with Node

——

# What is an HTTP Server?

* Servers respond to requests from clients
* clients and servers communicate via HTTP
* a request consists of a method and a URL and optionally more data
* anything that makes requests to a server is called a client
	* browser, mobile app, cURL, another server
* server has software that determines how to respond to a request

---

# Servers then and now

* 90’s servers: respond to a request from a browser for a webpage with an HTML document
serve static files (CSS, images, scripts) included by that HTML document
* Today’s servers: respond to requests from anywhere with static files OR
  * dynamic HTML, JSON, XML, and more

—--

### Example

* Web Browser makes a request to nodeschool.io
* (DNS routing takes place)
* Server receives GET request for “/“ URL
* Static file server automatically sends the index.html file located at its root directory, along with a 200 status code (OK)

--- 

### Example

* Web Browser makes a request to github.com/nodeschool
* Server receives GET request for ‘/nodeschool’ URL
* Software running on the server: 
  * determines that the requested resource is a user with the name “nodeschool”
  * Looks in the database for the user with the name “nodeschool”
  * Finds the template associated with displaying a user
  * Uses info from the database to fill in the blanks in the template
  * Sends the resulting HTML back to the client with a 200 status code (OK)

---

### Example 

* A script running on nytimes.com makes an AJAX request to nytimes.com/services/weather?location=toronto
* Server receives a GET request for /weather with the parameters {location: ‘toronto’} and a header of `Content-type: application/json`
* Software running on server:
  * looks up weather for location “toronto”
  * Formats response as JSON
  * Sends JSON back to client
* script uses data from JSON response to update a <p> tag on the page with the new information

---

### Example

* Web browser makes request to instagram.com/tessa
* All requests to instagram.com just get back the same index.html file
* JavaScript in index.html makes an ajax request to "api/users/tessa" based on the browser's url
* Server receives GET request for /api/users/tessa
* Software running on server: 
  * determines requested resource is a user
  * looks in database for user with username "tessa"
  * formats data from database as JSON
  * sends it back to browser with `Content-type: application/json` header
* JavaScript in the browser:
  * receives JSON response and parses into JS objects
  * Feeds data into react templates

---

### Example 

* Web browser makes a request to shopify.com/asldksj222
* Server receives GET request for /asldksj222
* Software on server:
  * tries to match /asldksj222 to something it has instructions for
  * finds no match
  * responds with the file 404.html and status code 404 (not found)

# Let’s make a node http server

* We’re building the software that receives an HTTP request, determines what to do about it, and sends back a response to a client
* Server software can be written in any language that the server knows how to run
* We’re going to use javascript, so we’ll need a server that runs node

---

# Getting set up

* make a new flie server.js
* import the `http` module

```
var http = require('http');

```

---

# Creating a Server

* use the `http.createServer` method to create a server
* call `server.listen` to start the server listening on a specific port. 

```
var server = http.createServer(); 

server.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('server is listening on port 8080');
});
```

* run `node server.js` to start the server
* our server doesn't actually _do_ anything when it gets a request

---

# Listening for requests

* the `server` is an instance of `EventEmitter`, meaning it has an `on` method for listening for events

```
server.on('request', function (request, response) {
  console.log(request);
});

```

* visit localhost:8080 in your browser

---

# "Hello World"

* We can add content to our `response` object with `response.write`
* when we're ready to send our response back, use `response.end()`

```
server.on('request', function (request, response) {
  response.write('Hello world');
  response.end();
});

```

---

# Error handling

```
request.on('error', function(err) {
  console.error(err);
});

response.on('error', function(err) {
  console.error(err);
});
```


---

# Responding with static files

* create an index.html file with some arbitrary content
* use the `fs` module to read the file and write it to the repsonse object

```
var fs = require('fs');

server.on('request', function (request, response) {
  fs.readFile('index.html', function (error, contents) {
    response.write(contents);
    response.end();
  });
});

```

---

# Some basic routing

* we can do different things based on the requested URL by comparing the `request.url` string

```
server.on('request', function (request, response) {
  if (request.url === '/home') {
    fs.readFile('index.html', function (error, contents) {
      response.write(contents);
      response.end();
    });
  } else {
    response.write('not found');
    response.statusCode = 404;
    response.end();
  }
});

```

---

# Dynamic Routing

* Web servers often have "routers", which determine what behaviours to run depending on what URL was entered. 
* We can capture he URL or parts of it and use that value as inputs for our software
* think of a URL like a function call: /users/123 could read as `getUser(123)` where `123` is a user ID. 
* we can do dynamic routing more easily using a regular expression

```
var re = /^\/currencies\/(\w+)/;
``` 

This regex will match URLs with the format /currencies/[string] and will remember the value of [string]

---

# Dynamic Routing cont'd

* Say we have an object that stores the values for currencies:

```
var currencies = {
  'CAD': 1.3,
  'GBP': 0.78,
  'JPY': 110.3,
}

```

* We want to return the currency value for the currency code in the URL

---

* the captured string from the regex is in the return value from `string.match`

```
  var match = request.url.match(re);

  if (match) {
    var value = currencies[match[1]];
    response.write(value);
    response.end();
  } else {
    response.write('not found');
    response.statusCode = 404;
    response.end(); 
  }
```

---

# Dynamic HTML

* We can combine dynamic routing + file rendering

```
  if (match) {
    fs.readFile('./currency.html', 'utf-8', function (error, contents) {
      var output = contents.replace('$contents', currencies[match[1]]);
      response.write(output, 'utf-8');
      response.end();
    });
  } else {
```

---

# Parsing a CSV

* we can bring in the `node-csv` module to parse a CSV file with more data

```
var csv = require('node-csv').createParser();

csv.mapFile('rates.csv', function (error, content) {

});

```

---

# Filtering through data

Since the csv is giving us an array, we need to loop through it to find the row with the matching currency code. 

```
csv.mapFile('rates.csv', function (error, content) {
  var currency = content.find(function (row) {
    return match[1].toUpperCase() === row.currency;
  });
});
```

---

# Returning HTML

```
csv.mapFile('rates.csv', function (error, content) {
  var currency = content.find(function (row) {
    return match[1].toUpperCase() === row.currency;
  });
  if (currency) {
    var string = `the value for ${match[1]} is ${currency.value}`;
    var output = contents.replace('$contents', string);
    response.write(output, 'utf-8');
    response.end();
  } else {
    response.statusCode = 400;
    response.write('Not a valid country code')
    response.end();
  }
});
```

---

# Returning JSON

```
if (currency) {
  var output = {
    currency: currency.currency,
    value: currency.value
  }
  response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  response.write(JSON.stringify(output), 'utf-8');
  response.end();
} else {
  response.statusCode = 400;
  response.write('Not a valid country code')
  response.end();
}

```

---

# Parsing a query string

We can allow a consumer of our API to add more info by parsing a _query string_. 

GET /currencies/JPN?value=10 will convert 10 USD to JPN

To get the query string of a URL, we can call string.split with ? 

```
var query = request.url.split('?')[1];
```

---

# Using querystring

Bring in the node querystring module to parse the querystring into an object

```
var querystring = require('querystring');
var query = request.url.split('?')[1];
if (query) {
  var input = querystring.parse(query);
}
```

This will give us an object that looks like 

```
{
  value: '10'
}
```

---

# Converting currency values

Now we just have to mulitply the input value by the currency value

```
if (query) {
  var input = querystring.parse(query);
  output['converted'] = parseFloat(input.value) * currency.value;
}
```

---

# Putting the frontend and backend together

Let's go back to the index.html file that gets served by the /home route and add a couple form elements and a <script> tag.

```
<input id="currency" type="text" />
<input id="amount" type="text" />
<button id="submit" type="button">Submit</button>

<p id="contents"></p>

<script type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

---

# Using `fetch` on the frontend

When the button is clicked, we'll use `fetch` to call our /currencies endpoint

```
document.getElementById('submit').addEventListener('click', function () {
  fetch(`/currencies/CDN`).then(function (res) {
    return res.json().then(function (contents) {
      console.log(contents);
    });
  });
});
```

---

# Fetching with dynamic values

Get the `value`s from our form fields to construct the URL paramters and query string

```

var currency = document.getElementById('currency').value;
var amount = document.getElementById('amount').value;

var url = `/currencies/${currency}?value=${amount}`;
```

---

# Displaying the result

```
fetch(url).then(function (res) {
  return res.json().then(function (contents) {
    var string = `${amount} USD = ${contents.converted} ${contents.currency}`;
    document.getElementById('contents').innerHTML = string;
  });
});
```
